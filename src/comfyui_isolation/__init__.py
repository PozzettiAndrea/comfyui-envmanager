comfyui-isolation: Process isolation for ComfyUI custom nodes.

This package provides a clean API for running ComfyUI node code in isolated
Python virtual environments, solving dependency conflicts between nodes.

Example usage:

    from comfyui_isolation import IsolatedEnv, WorkerBridge
    from pathlib import Path

    # Define the isolated environment
    env = IsolatedEnv(
        name="my-node",
        python="3.10",
        cuda="12.8",
        requirements=["torch==2.8.0", "nvdiffrast"],
    )

    # Create bridge to communicate with isolated process
    bridge = WorkerBridge(env, worker_script=Path("worker.py"))

    # Ensure environment is set up
    bridge.ensure_environment()

    # Call functions in the isolated environment
    result = bridge.call("process_image", image=my_image)
"""
